"""Match a CIS to its presentation within a multi-presentation EMA PDF.

One EMA PDF bundles one SmPC/Notice per device (cartouche, KwikPen, Tempo Pen…).
Several CIS share the PDF, one per presentation. We pick, for each CIS, the
presentation whose denomination best matches the CIS's ``SpecDenom01`` using
Jaccard similarity over normalized tokens. Jaccard naturally prefers the tighter
match — e.g. a generic "…stylo prérempli" CIS maps to the KwikPen presentation
rather than "Tempo Pen …stylo prérempli", whose extra tokens lower the overlap.
